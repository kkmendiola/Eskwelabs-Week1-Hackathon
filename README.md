# Eskwelabs-Week1-Hackathon
Prompt 1:

First, use and merge the data sets available to you. 

Create a new array where you calculate the change in enrollment from 2012 to 2015 for each school as a % of each schoolâ€™s 2012 enrollment level. </br>
  Calculate the average, minimum, and maximum of this new array.</br>
  What do these values mean? Interpret the data. </br>
  
  
Calculate the correlation between change in enrollment and latitude. Build your own correlation function - do not call anything from numpy or math modules.</br> 
  Use your correlation function on enrollment and the other variables.</br> 
  Group the variables in order of correlation with enrollment.</br>
  Does this surprise you?  Interpret the data.</br>
  Look at a pair of highly correlated variables and describe why you think this may be.</br> 
  What might be some implications for policy-makers and education officials?</br>

Identify the 95th percentile schools in each province in terms of change in enrollment. Build your own percentile function - do not call anything from numpy or math modules. </br>
  Use your correlation function to look for similarities among the schools. Interpret these.</br>
  What do you think made these schools higher performing in terms of boosting enrollment over time?</br>
