# Eskwelabs-Week1-Hackathon

Prompt 1:

First, use and merge the data sets available to you. 

Create a new array where you calculate the change in enrollment from 2012 to 2015 for each school as a % of each schoolâ€™s 2012 enrollment level.
  Calculate the average, minimum, and maximum of this new array.
  What do these values mean? Interpret the data.

Calculate the correlation between change in enrollment and latitude. Build your own correlation function - do not call anything from numpy or math modules. 
  Use your correlation function on enrollment and the other variables. 
  Group the variables in order of correlation with enrollment.
  Does this surprise you?  Interpret the data.
  Look at a pair of highly correlated variables and describe why you think this may be. 
  What might be some implications for policy-makers and education officials?

Identify the 95th percentile schools in each province in terms of change in enrollment. Build your own percentile function - do not call anything from numpy or math modules. 
  Use your correlation function to look for similarities among the schools. Interpret these.
  What do you think made these schools higher performing in terms of boosting enrollment over time?
